Generate a Groovy Vert.x 3 project using [[http://codeworker.free.fr/][CodeWorker]].

Currently the generated project contains:

- A Maven =pom.xml= file configured to use Vert.x 3.5.2 with Groovy;
- A =Main= groovy class starting the application and deploying the Verticles;
- Verticles defined in the project file;
- =.gitignore=.

To create the project, change the =project.txt= file at the root, and set the following properties:

- =name= :: Name of the application
- =group= :: Maven group, this will also be used as the Groovy package name
- =verticles= :: Comma-separated list of Verticles to create and deploy.
